<p><strong>Hot &amp; Juicy Crawfish</strong> restaurant is a seafood restaurant that has a unique blend of Louisiana style with hot Asian spicy taste to the food. I found this restaurant a couple years ago and just fell in love with the food.  Especially the Hot &amp; Juicy crawfish that is made with fresh/live crawfish. I was introduce to this place when I was visiting Las Vegas, Nevada and everytime I go back, I always find time to visit this restaurant each time.</p>
  <h3>Some of my favorite dishes at Hot &amp; Juicy are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="feature"><strong>Hot &amp; Juicy Extra Spicy Crawfish</strong></li>

    <li>Raw Oysters</li>  	
    <li>Fried Catfish Basket</li>
